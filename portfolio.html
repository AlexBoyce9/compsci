    	<p style="color:Black;"> We built a game based on Final Fantasy 7 battle system and it ended up super good! We coded 9 unique moves for the player character and 4 for the boss itself with damage rolls and accuracy stats for each attack. Both players have HP and you have the ability to lose the fight.
