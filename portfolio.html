	<p> We built a game based on Final Fantasy 7 battle system and it ended up super good! We coded 9 unique moves for the player character and 4 for the boss itself with damage rolls and accuracy stats for each attack. Both players have HP and you have the ability to lose the fight. </p>

	<p> We recreated Donkey Kong as more of a platformer for our 1.2.5 project and it was a lot of fun, we added user input so you can actually play the game with a starting screen and a restart button in case you mess up, it was a lot of fun to play and it took a while but enjoy! </p>
